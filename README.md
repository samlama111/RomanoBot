## Running locally using Docker

1. Check that you have Docker installed and started.
2. Navigate to the `hdfs-docker-cluster/` folder and run `docker-compose up --build`. This will start the HDFS service - a name node and a data node + a client insert data into the HDFS.
3. The services can be stop using `docker-compose down`.

## (TODO:) Running with a deployed cluster/service
